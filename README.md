## Overview

This study introduces a diagnostic protocol using causal and conformal differential operators \( D \) and \( D' \), applied to the density field of the Eridanus supervoid. The methodology includes:

- Persistent topology for boundary detection
- Wavelet-SPH density field reconstruction
- Relaxation analysis through elastic energy balance
- Prediction of redshift distortions via \( D'\rho \)
- Computation of the cosmic Poisson ratio \( \nu \)
- Comparison with weak lensing convergence \( \kappa \)

The figures and results were generated entirely from the scripts provided in this repository.
