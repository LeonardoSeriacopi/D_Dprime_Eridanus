## 🗂 Repository Structure

- `Scripts/` — Python scripts used to compute the operators $D$ and $D'$ based on the density profile.
- `Figures/` — All generated figures used in the analysis and manuscript.
- `Paper/` — Source files and compiled PDF for the final manuscript.
- `Data/` — Contains raw data extraction scripts for the Eridanus SDSS sample.

## 📌 Summary

The scripts in this repository implement a new approach for analyzing causal and conformal structure in cosmic voids.  
Operators $D$ and $D'$ are calculated from a synthetic radial profile of the Eridanus Supervoid. The methodology is inspired by elastic spacetime formalisms and is entirely model-independent.
