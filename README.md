# D & D' Operators — Eridanus Supervoid

This repository provides all scripts and sample data used in the research note titled:

**"Elastic Dynamics in Voids: Visualization of D and D′ Operators in Underdense Cosmology"**

## Contents

- `scripts/` — Python scripts for generating and analyzing the radial density profile of the Eridanus Supervoid.
- `data/` — Sample datasets and model profiles used in the computation.
- `figures/` — Optional visualization outputs (not included in AAS submission).
- `notebooks/` — Future expansion area for interactive demonstrations.

## Main Features

- Implements the $D$ (causal derivative) and $D'$ (conformal adjoint) operators.
- Models a realistic radial density profile based on Eridanus.
- Includes operator visualization logic (matplotlib-based).
- Fully documented and reproducible.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
python scripts/generate_eridanus_density_model.py
```

For D and D′ operators:

```bash
python scripts/operator_D.py
python scripts/operator_Dprime.py
```
