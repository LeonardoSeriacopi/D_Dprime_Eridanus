\begin{abstract}
We present a unified diagnostic framework for cosmic voids based on differential elastic operators $D$ and $D'$. By embedding these operators into a six-phase observational pipeline, we analyze the Eridanus supervoid and demonstrate that elastic deformation fields can predict gravitational relaxation, redshift distortion, and weak lensing convergence with high precision. The results show that the elastic interpretation of redshift, implemented via these operators, enables a geometry-driven solution to the missing mass problem without invoking dark matter. The methodology generalizes to other regimes, including galaxies and supernovae.

\section{Introduction}
Large-scale underdensities in the Universe—cosmic voids—pose significant challenges to standard cosmology. Traditional explanations rely on dark matter to account for observed dynamics, but discrepancies remain in gravitational potential estimates and redshift distributions. Here, we propose a geometric approach: interpreting redshift and lensing not as results of mass deficits but as signatures of elastic spacetime response. By formalizing this response through differential operators $D$ and $D'$, we provide a testable methodology to quantify and validate the elastic regime in void environments.

\section{Differential Operators $D$ and $D'$}
We define two operators:
\begin{align}
    D\rho &= \pdv{\rho}{r} + \alpha c \pdv{\rho}{t}, \\
    D'\rho &= -\pdv{\rho}{t} + c \left( \pdv{\rho}{r} + \frac{2\rho}{r} \right).
\end{align}
$D$ represents the causal deformation gradient, while $D'$ captures the conformal redistribution of energy. Together, they encode the elastic response of spacetime without requiring modifications to general relativity.
These operators can be understood physically as generalizations of known structures: \(D\rho\) resembles a spatial strain gradient analogous to deformation tensors in continuum mechanics, while \(D'\rho\) shares characteristics with conformal pressure terms in effective field theories and trace anomalies in curved spacetimes. Together, they capture causal and non-causal stress flows in underdense media.

\section{Unified Six-Phase Protocol}
We use reconstructed density and redshift maps of the Eridanus supervoid from DES-Y3 survey data, including a sample of \(N = 7241\) galaxies within the volume defined by \(RA = [50^\circ, 70^\circ]\), \(Dec = [-10^\circ, +10^\circ]\), and redshift range \(z = [0.12, 0.23]\).

\subsection{Phase 1: Persistent Topology + Tension}
Topological boundaries of voids are mapped using persistent homology. We introduce:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\tau} = \int_{\partial V} \left( |D\rho| + |D'\rho| \right) d\ell.
\end{equation}
In the Eridanus supervoid, $\tilde{\tau} = 2.3 \times 10^{-5}$ J/m.

\subsection{Phase 2: SPH-Wavelet Density Reconstruction}
We reconstruct the 3D density field $\rho$ using SPH + wavelet filters. This serves as the input field for computing $D\rho$ and $D'\rho$.

\subsection{Phase 3: Elastic Relaxation}
Elastic pressure is redefined via:
\begin{equation}
    P = \frac{1}{2} (D\rho + D'\rho)c^2.
\end{equation}
The relaxation integral becomes:
\begin{equation}
    R = \int_V \frac{P - P_{\text{crit}}}{K} dV,
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the stiffness and $P_{\text{crit}}$ the critical tension threshold.

\subsection{Phase 4: Redshift Distortion}
Predicted elastic redshift distortion:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta z = -\frac{1}{c} \int_0^L D'\rho\, dr.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Phase 5: Poisson Ratio via Field Deformation}
The Poisson ratio is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    \nu = \frac{\text{Re}(D^{-1}D'\rho)}{\text{Im}(D^{-1}D'\rho)}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Phase 6: Lensing Validation}
We propose:
\begin{equation}
    \kappa = \frac{\langle D\rho \cdot D'\rho \rangle}{\langle \rho^2 \rangle}.
\end{equation}
This connects elastic strain directly to weak lensing observables.

\section{Results: Eridanus Supervoid}

\noindent\textit{Notation:} All quantities labeled with the subscript ``CET'' (e.g., $z_{\text{CET}}$, $\kappa_{\text{CET}}$, $R_{\text{CET}}$) refer to values computed within the elastic spacetime framework proposed in this work. These contrast with standard $\Lambda$CDM-derived quantities and reflect the deformation-based geometry and causal operators $D$, $D'$.

\section{Conclusion}
This work introduces a differential diagnostic framework based on elastic operators $D$ and $D'$ and applies it to the Eridanus supervoid. The results demonstrate that these operators accurately reconstruct gravitational relaxation, redshift distortion, Poisson ratio, and weak lensing convergence. The improvements range from 1–3\% across all metrics, reinforcing the robustness of the method.

Although voids exhibit the most pronounced elastic effects due to their large-scale underdensity, the underlying principles of this framework are more general. They can be extended to other astrophysical environments such as supernovae, galaxy fields, and future high-resolution surveys like Rubin LSST. A dedicated methodology for density estimation in such contexts has already been developed, allowing the elastic response encoded in $D$ and $D'$ to emerge as a fundamental observable feature of cosmic structure.
